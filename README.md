# Lisp Interpreter

Experiments w/ writing a LISP interpreter.

## Current Features:

- Lists, S-Expressions
- Lazy evaluation

## TODO:

- macro system
- make it self hosting
- system for syntactic sugar? (might just do this via macros)
- types?
- Clean up code, maybe make it a standardized tool for writing PLs?
- Custom tokenizer/parser
- Improved REPL
  - highlighting?
  - completion?
